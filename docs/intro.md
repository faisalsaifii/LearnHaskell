# Introduction

Getting started with Haskell:

- What is Haskell?
- Haskell tooling overview
- Expressions
- Type inference
- Parametric polymorphism and overloading
- IO and explicit effects
- Datatypes and functions
- Pattern matching
- Lazy evaluation

## What is Haskell?

- Designed by a committee to create a standard lazy and
functional language.
- Haskell 1.0 Report released 1990.
- Several iterations up to Haskell 98, released 1999.
- Minor revision of standard in Haskell 2010.
- A lot of development since then, but primarily outside of the
standard, in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC).

## Haskell tooling

### GHCi

- Interactive component shipped with GHC.
- Use to quickly try out things, evaluate Haskell expressions, obtain
(type) information, and test your programs.

### Editor (potentially with haskell-language-server)

- Use to define Haskell modules containing declarations.
- Test these developments using GHCi again.
